# 📘 ALX Frontend ProDev JavaScript: TypeScript Projects

Welcome to my **ALX ProDev-Frontend TypeScript repository**, a hands-on deep dive into mastering **TypeScript**, a strongly typed superset of JavaScript. This repo showcases my progress in applying OOP principles, advanced types, interfaces, and ambient declarations — all aligned with real-world frontend application development.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This repository contains TypeScript projects structured by learning tasks. Each task progressively builds a stronger understanding of TypeScript fundamentals and advanced features through practical implementations and compiler configurations.

## 🧠 What I’ve Learned

- ✅ Setting up TypeScript in a modern frontend environment
- ✅ Working with **Interfaces**, **Type Aliases**, and **Classes**
- ✅ Mastering **Inheritance**, **Declaration Merging**, and **Namespaces**
- ✅ Using **Ambient Declarations** with third-party JS libraries
- ✅ Applying **Advanced Types** like string literals and union types
- ✅ Embracing **Nominal Typing** with brand conventions
- ✅ Configuring **Webpack** and **tsconfig.json** for smooth TS compilation

## 📂 Project Structure

```bash
0x04-TypeScript/
├── task_0/              # Student Interface & DOM manipulation
├── task_1/              # Teacher Interface, Class, and OOP basics
├── task_2/              # Advanced Types & Employee logic
├── task_3/              # Ambient Types & External JS usage
├── task_4/              # Namespaces, Declaration Merging, and Inheritance
├── task_5/              # Nominal Typing using Brand Convention

Each task contains:

    main.ts — Core logic

    package.json — Project config & dependencies

    tsconfig.json — TypeScript compiler options

    webpack.config.js — Webpack bundling settings

    Optional: .eslintrc.js — Linting rules (for code quality)

🛠️ Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/Joshuakibwage/alx-frontend-javascript.git
cd alx-frontend-javascript/0x04-TypeScript/task_<number>

2. Install Dependencies

npm install

3. Run Webpack Dev Server

npm run start

4. Build for Production

npm run build

💡 Sample Output

Here’s a peek into the kind of functionality you’ll find:

printTeacher("John", "Doe") // Output: J. Doe

createEmployee(200) // Instance of Teacher
createEmployee(1000) // Instance of Director

teachClass('Math') // Output: Teaching Math
